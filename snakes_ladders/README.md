# Snakes and Ladders Shortest-Path Problem

## Premise
This problem, obtained from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) as "The Quickest Way Up", presents the question: What is the minimum number of moves from square 1 to square 100 in a snakes-and-ladders game with arbitrary control over the die? 

It is known that the board will always be 100 squares in size, and the die can return 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 at your choosing. There will be no more than 15 snakes and 15 ladders, and no snakes or ladders will share any endpoints. If no path to square 100 exists, the code is to return the value "-1".


## Implementation
